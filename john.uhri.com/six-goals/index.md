What is the purpose of software engineering (and software engineers)?

> My golden rule of software engineering: our job as engineers is not to turn product specs into code. Our job is to deliver the maximum value for the company at the lowest cost.

> Rod Begbie, [Estimating Your Way to Success](https://leaddev.com/productivity-eng-velocity/estimating-your-way-success)

Mike Crittenden agrees:

> You were hired to help the company accomplish its goals, and your role in these goals is probably far more complex than just "write beautiful code that works well."

> Mike Crittenden, [The Professional Coworker](https://critter.blog/2013/03/21/the-professional-coworker/)

What are the goals software engineers should strive for? They are these six things:

* Protect revenue 
* Increase revenue 
* Manage cost 
* Increase brand value 
* Make the product remarkable 
* Provide more value to your customers
