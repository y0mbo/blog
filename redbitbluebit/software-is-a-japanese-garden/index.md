[Japanese Gardens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_garden) are beautiful. These gardens are works of art carefully grown over years by sensei gardeners. Even the simplest of gardens takes careful planning, cultivating and care-taking to become amazing places for relaxation, solitude, and meditation.

Building a garden may only take a season, but it is years before the garden reaches its full potential. Plants need to fill in and overgrow areas. Other spots may need to be re-cultivated when certain plants don't grow well in the soil or with the available light. Sometimes a planter needs to be moved so visitors won't stub a toe. Then there are the weeds. The gardeners are ever vigilant and tend to their gardens daily.

Like a Japanese Garden, software takes time. Software developer Joel Spolsky contends that [Good Software Takes 10 Years](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html) to develop. I agree. The first version of a web application is only good enough to engage early adopters and to solicit feedback. Only after this feedback is absorbed and implemented does the software begin to meet its potential.

## I want a clone of Groupon, but with...

When I see project listings on freelance gig sites, I first smirk a little and then roll my eyes. Both the project sponsors and the bidders are setting themselves up for a rude awakening. The sponsors want a Groupon clone, but with one different feature that will make them millions of dollars. However, they want to pay practically nothing for the development of the software. Then there are the bidders - the developers who believe they can implement a clone of Groupon for a few thousand dollars.

The problem is the hubris of software developers. Most of them see a site like Groupon and think about a couple of database tables. "That's not that hard to implement," they think to themselves. "I can do that in a week."

Putting together the basic version in a week probably is doable with today's technology. But it will be terrible. Back to our garden analogy, it is as if the gardener brought in all the plants and arranged them in basically the right places, but the plants are still in the black plastic planting pots! A thousand small details remain to be done.

Software developer Benjamin Pollack wrote about this in response to Hacker News commenters who believed they could write a Stack Overflow or Twitter clone in a weekend:

> "There is a tremendous amount of spit and polish that goes into making a major website highly usable. A developer, asked how hard something will be to clone, simply does not think about the polish, because the polish is incidental to the implementation." - [Benjamin Pollack](http://blog.bitquabit.com/2009/07/01/one-which-i-call-out-hacker-news/)

Most developers think of a couple of database tables and a few screens. It's hardly the start of it, though. Even a well-built version 1.0 is missing a lot of features. It's the basic version. There aren't any administration screens. There isn't any fancy AJAX. It's just the bare bones that meet the minimum of requirements. Version 1.0 sucks, quite frankly.

## John Uhri: Software Developer and Digital Gardener

Software doesn't stay in a perpetual sucky 1.0 forever. There is hope, and that hope is a long-term view. Good software needs to be cultivated. It has a lot of nuances. It's certainly more like gardening than it is stamping out skid plates for SUVs. Software is a culmination of thousands of small decisions, most of which aren't even code.

When your business needs to create a software garden to improve your bottom line, seek out a digital gardener who shares your vision for the future. As that vision is implemented, your software garden will grow to full bloom.
