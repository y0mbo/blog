As a business owner, you decide the technical infrastructures of your organization. Part of choosing wisely is knowing your options. In this post, we will cover the five major categories of software. Each category has advantages and disadvantages

## Shrinkwrapped (or Off-The-Shelf) software

Software purchased and used as-is is called "shrinkwrapped" or "off-the-shelf" software. It is a bit of a misnomer since most software is purchased online today, but the name comes from the boxes of software sitting on retail store shelves. The features in shrink-wrapped software are fixed - you typically can't request a feature specific to your own business. Most off-the-shelf software is aimed at broad audiences that allow the software to be sold in volume and at a lower price-point.

* **Purchase channel:** Retail stores or online retailers.
* **Upgrade path:** Incremental upgrades are usually free. Upgrade licenses for major updates must be purchased.
* **Cost:** Varies based on features, breadth of market segmentation (vertical or horizontal), and consumer versus business use.
* **Examples:** Microsoft Office, Mac OS/X.
* **Advantages:** Easily available. Makes sense for common business functions.
* **Disadvantages:** No customization beyond application options. May not meet business needs.

## Consultingware

Expensive large-scale software applications that provide a specific business function such as accounting or inventory management. Large software applications can be customized to meet the needs of each individual business as closely as possible.

* **Purchase channel:** Work with a salesperson and a customization team.
* **Upgrade path:** Yearly service contracts may cover some upgrades. Major updates may require re-licensing the software.
* **Cost:** Can be expensive with installation costs and service plans.
* **Examples:** SAP, SalesLogix, inventory, and accounting packages.
* **Advantages:** Less expensive than designing the same application from scratch. Can be customized to match your business.
* **Disadvantages:** May not work exactly how your business does.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS is a new category of software growing in popularity over the last 5 years. SaaS is a completely web-based model. The software is accessed through a browser on the vendor's website. You subscribe on a monthly or yearly basis and your data is stored on the web. Upgrades are automatically applied by the vendor as soon as they are available.

* **Purchase channel:** Web-based subscription at vendor's website
* **Upgrade path:** None - SaaS applications are always running the latest version.
* **Cost:** Monthly subscriptions vary based on plans that are based on the amount of data you will need.
* **Examples:** Basecamp, Freshbooks, Facebook, Salesforce
* **Advantages:** No installation needed because it runs in a browser. Always running the latest version of the software. No data to back up.
* **Disadvantages:** Requires an internet connection. Data is stored offsite from your location.

## Open Source

Open Source software is built by individuals or teams and released to the public where it is updated by the open source community. There is a huge variance in the quality (both features and stability) of open source software.

* **Purchase channel:** Downloaded from open source websites or product home page.
* **Upgrade path:** Download the newer version and install when available.
* **Cost:** Free. Some companies offer support contracts to maintain it for you.
* **Examples:** Mozilla Firefox, Wordpress, Linux
* **Advantages:** Free. Can be customized by a programmer to add features. May have already developed a solution to your business needs.
* **Disadvantages:**  Generally, no support. May have poor usability. Maybe buggy. Upgrades may not work if the software has been customized. Licensing may restrict the ability to make private changes. Smaller projects may be abandoned by its developers.

Custom Software

Custom software is designed and developed by a company or a software developer on behalf of a company. Software specifically designed for a business should provide the "secret sauce" that sets the business apart from its competitors.

* **Purchase channel:** Work with a software developer (company or freelancer) to design and develop custom software. Can also be built by in-house IT departments.
* **Upgrade path:** New features must be built by a software developer.
* **Cost:** Expensive.
* **Examples:** Many behind-the-firewall applications that are never seen outside of the company that built it. Amazon.com, eBay, or Netflix websites are examples of custom-built web applications.
* **Advantages:** Works how you need it to. Can give you a competitive advantage. You own the product.
* **Disadvantages:** Development cycle is longer than purchased software.
