Our current home has an in-ground sprinkler system. It's great, I never have to worry about watering the grass because it's totally programmable. I like things that are programmable. Automation is very sweet.

One thing that isn't automated is the spring startup and fall shutdown services. Twice a year I have to call the company that services our sprinkler system to have them come out and remove or replace the primary valve for the system. Apparently, there's also a backflow certification that needs to be done on an annual basis. I'll leave out my thoughts of what kind of a government-enforced scam enacted by the irrigation companies that is.

Last week, I finally remembered to call to schedule an appointment. The woman who answered the phone was very nice and informed me that no one in scheduling was available to set up an appointment for me, but she promised me she would get back to me once the scheduler had a time frame.

This morning when I walked outside to grab the paper at the end of the driveway (yes, I get an actual, physical paper. The shock!), I saw a service truck for the irrigation company across the street at my neighbor's house. The installer was in the yard doing his thing. I shook my head and thought, "What a wasted opportunity."

I called the company later this morning to find out what the status was. Possibly the same woman answered the phone, and you can tell she gets the "when's my appointment" question relatively frequently. She didn't even ask for my name, she just told me I hadn't been called back because there was no appointment yet. When I mentioned the installer across the street, she said that appointment had been made a while ago, and they have a large backlog. Again, I thought "What a wasted opportunity."

## What is the goal of software?

There are five goals for any software development project. If your business is planning to build software that doesn't meet any of these goals, the project should be canceled before real money is spent on it. Software should:

<dl>
<dt>Protect revenue</dt>
<dd>Protecting revenue means closing sales faster. When a business can close sales faster, they can close more sales. The software automates steps in the sales cycle making your business more efficient.</dd>
<dt>Increase revenue</dt>
<dd>New markets can be created by using software by servicing customers in a new way, or simply serving the existing market better.</dd>
<dt>Manage cost</dt>
<dd>Eliminating waste, speeding up processes and eliminating repetition all manage costs associated with your business. The software helps you manage the costs and can even eliminate some costs.</dd>
<dt>Increase brand value</dt>
<dd>Websites and the software running on them shape the perception clients have about your company and brand. Your software should increase your perception in the marketplace, not decrease it.</dd>
<dt>Provide more value to your customers or employees</dt>
<dd>Making the jobs of your employees and the hectic schedule of your customers better is another goal your software should meet.</dt>
</dl>

## Sprinklers and schedules
After my "wasted opportunity" interactions with my irrigation company, I easily thought of ways their business could be improved and software could meet all five goals. Primarily, the company's ability to schedule work appointments at their customer's homes is one of the biggest hurdles they face. Here are a few thoughts:

* Using smart routing algorithms, software could be used to send installers to locations using the smartest path. Manage Cost by speeding up in-between installation appointment drive times and saving fuel costs.
* Pre-scheduling spring startups: calling existing customers and suggesting an appointment for service. Service appointments are grouped based on subdivision or city. Manage Cost by eliminating repeat trips to the same area. Provide Value to Customers by proactively contacting them for service. Protect Revenue by keeping in touch with their customers on a regular basis. Increase Revenue by promoting the scheduling system to new clients and potentially offering a discount for neighbor referrals.
* Building an easy scheduling system for call-ins that can be scheduled by anyone in the office. Provide Value to Employees by eliminating the need to answer multiple calls about the same issue. Manage Cost and Protect Revenue by not having the scheduling handled by only one person, but by any employee.
* Automatic web-based scheduling so customers can schedule their own appointments. Increase Revenue by serving the existing market and having an online system to attract new tech-savvy homeowners. Manage Cost by eliminating some steps in the scheduling process.

I see many possibilities for a scheduling system that could really kick the company into high gear and solve many efficiency problems that turn into long appointment lead times.
