Most geeks are lazy. Not in a sit-on-the-couch-and-eat-Doritos kind of way, but in an “If I have to do this more than once, there has to be a faster way” kind of way. Most software was bred out of this mindset, as were things like keyboard shortcuts. A good geek will be able to show you tips and tricks that will make you more efficient. An excellent geek may even see a whole better way to save your time.

What’s interesting is that sometimes a workflow solution can make a huge difference. Once you’ve squeezed all of the efficiency out of your workflow, then you should look at software solutions that change your workflow.
