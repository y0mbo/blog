Have you ever seen those cartoons where a character falls down a mountain slope, gains momentum and rolls into a snowball that grows and grows as it rolls downhill until it devours everything in its path? Pretty funny, isn't it? They even have a video game called "Katamari" in Japan based on the idea. Here's a Traveller's insurance commercial based on the Katamari snowball effect:

Personal finance coach Dave Ramsey uses this idea to help people pay down their debt. He calls it the debt snowball, of course. In the debt snowball, you make minimum payments on your bills and put any extra money toward paying off your smallest bill. When that bill is paid, the money that went toward it is applied to the next smallest bill. This process is repeated until all of your bills have been paid.

What is it about the debt snowball that gives such great results? It is the psychological effect of scoring an early victory. When that first bill is paid off, you get a wave of euphoria from the accomplishment and it motivates you as you work to pay off the next bill.

## The Technology Snowball

As a business owner, you may not even know of the best place to start in automating your business processes. But you can apply the idea of the Katamari snowball effect and score some easy wins for your company.

The steps are as follows:

* Find a process step to automate
* Implement the automation
* Verify the process improvement
* Repeat 1-3 with the next hardest step.

When you have so many good ways to improve your business, how do you choose which one to work on? Sometimes it is as simple as picking the easiest one. A small step that's a big bottleneck can be a big win:

> When you have identified a smaller part of the process that holds things up, go dig into that chunk of work. Almost always, there is some poor soul desperate for someone to help them. They often know they are the hold up, but are too overworked trying to keep up to actually do anything about it.Â (source)(sorry, dead link)

Software automation is best done in small evolutionary steps. Building a total solution in a single stage usually leads to software that doesn't solve the problems it was designed to solve. Understanding comes through solving the small problems first and rolling the efficiencies into the bigger problems.
